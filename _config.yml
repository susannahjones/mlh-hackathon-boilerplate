  about:
    description: >
      Diversity is not about difference or deficits. 
      We define diversity as excellence expressing itself through the intersection of perspectives and lived experiences. 
      So why does it matter? Where do technology and diversity converge? How can we use technology to advance issues in diversity?
      What can YOU invent to answer these questions? Diverse-a-thon UVA seeks to take hackathons to a new level through an event 
      filled with perspective changing moments. From workshops and talks by the most prominent thought leaders in diversity, 
      to participants filled to the brim with excellence and passion, we're excited to host you at The University of Virginia.
